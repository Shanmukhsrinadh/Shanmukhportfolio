Build a premium, design-heavy personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks required, but you may use GSAP, Three.js, or similar animation libraries if needed). The site must feel like a $5000 custom-built interactive portfolio — highly polished, immersive, and minimalist but visually striking.

CORE EXPERIENCE:
This portfolio should feel like a scroll-based story from header to footer. As the user scrolls, each section reveals with smooth scroll-triggered animations. Use cinematic transitions, motion typography, parallax, and subtle 3D effects where appropriate. Every element should feel intentional and animated — but not cluttered.

GLOBAL DESIGN RULES:
- Minimalist layout but high-end visual style
- Smooth scroll animations across entire site
- Scroll-triggered reveals for every section
- Light mode + Dark mode with toggle
- Glassmorphism or soft depth effects where appropriate
- Custom typography pairing (modern + elegant)
- Micro-interactions on hover
- Cursor glow/light reveal effect for background elements
- Responsive design for desktop + mobile
- Smooth performance (avoid lag)

CURSOR LIGHT REVEAL EFFECT:
Background elements across the site should initially appear hidden or dimmed. The mouse cursor should act like a “light source” that reveals them on hover using a radial gradient mask or spotlight effect. Apply this effect only to background decorative elements, icons, and floating visuals — not main text content.

SECTIONS TO BUILD:

1️⃣ HERO SECTION — INTRO STORY
- Full screen hero with animated typography

- Short intro about me
- Background animated particles or subtle 3D motion
- Scroll indicator animation

2️⃣ ABOUT + SKILLS SECTION
- Short professional bio
- Skill tools displayed as logos/icons
- Logos appear in darkness and reveal when cursor light passes over them
- Floating layout with parallax motion
- Hover glow effect on each tool
- Subtle depth / 3D transform on hover

3️⃣ CERTIFICATIONS SECTION
- Scroll reveal animation
- Show only 4 certificates initially
- Card-based layout with elegant animation

4️⃣ SERVICES SECTION
Display 3 main services with strong visual cards:

Include EmailJS integration code with placeholders:

Make these easy to replace.

The design should feel award-level, immersive, and unique — not template-like.
